<h1>Dog</h1>
<hr>
<p>A dog is a mammal in the order Carnivora. The history of dogs is an old tale indeed. You could say as long as there has been civilisation, there have been records of humans and dogs. Dogs were domesticated from wolves around 15,000 years ago. New evidence suggests that dogs were first domesticated in East Asia, possibly China.</p>
